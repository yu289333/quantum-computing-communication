\chapter*{Preface}
Quantum computing and communication are hot topics. Software development kits (SDKs) including IBM Qiskit and Google Cirq have been made available to software engineers. But they are useless if the engineers are not trained with quantum algorithms and protocols, which have been described as mysterious and incomprehensible. Can engineers be taught the algorithms and protocols without studying quantum physics? After all, the Nobel prize-winning physicist and one of the best educators, Richard Feynman, says “I think I can safely say that nobody really understands quantum mechanics.”

This book says "Yes!" The only concept that one needs to learn about quantum physics is that at the minuscule scale, a wave cannot be divided into any smaller portions in terms of its energy or mass. The rest of the undergraduate courses on quantum physics are about solving Schrödinger or Dirac equation for electron waves. But we all use Wi-Fi, cellular, cable, and optical fiber communications daily, which use electromagnetic waves underneath. Communication engineers can even design communication systems including protocols without learning how to solve wave equations. They do need to learn modulation theory though, which studies how information can be carried or represented by wave parameters. It is the key to linking waves to information. Communication and software engineers just need to study or review modulation theory in the context of quantum waves to understand quantum algorithms and protocols, and hopefully to be able to invent new ones.

\section{Arrangement of this book}
The first chapter \ref{c-intro} gives an overview of quantum technologies. The next chapter \ref{c-modulation} on classical modulation theory serves as a foundation for the quantum information discussion of chapter \ref{c-qinfo}. Quantum information differs from the classical theory because of the limitation of quantum measurement. Chapter \ref{c-comm} studies several quantum communication protocols, which use one to three qubits and are easy to understand. The rest focus on several n-qubit algorithms including Shor's algorithm and are arranged by design patterns. If any reader is interested in knowing how quantum qubits and gates work at the physical level, Appendix \ref{A-qubit} is reserved for this subject.

\chapter{Introduction}\label{c-intro}
The advantage of quantum computing lies in the possibility of parallel computing.

\section{The power of parallel computing}
Maze\index{Maze} problems are hard because there are too many paths to explore from the entrance to the exit. If changing the question of the problems from pinpointing the actual paths to finding the number of good paths, although seemingly dumb down, the challenge is as hard as the original. One still needs to explore all the possible paths to reach the conclusion.

Computer scientists have long known parallel computing\index{parallel computing} is the way to speed up solutions to such problems. But how to realize parallel computing needs the help of physicists. Indeed, a physicist would suggest the following experiment to attack the problem: run water into the entrance and observe what's coming out of the exit. If we see water out of the exit, we know the maze has at least one good path.

We can obtain more information if we explore the water experiment further: put several drops of water into the entrance at the same time and observe which drop comes out first or last. Apparently, the time lapse between a drop's entrance to exit carries the length information of the path, which it travels. But what happens if two drops come out at the same time? Clearly, the traveling time of a water drop alone is not sufficient to extract more information from the maze.

The clever physicist may suggest adding color to the experiment: design a mechanism so that a water drop is stained with a different color when it is bounced back from a dead-end. When we see a purple drop twice as big exiting, we can be sure that it is a mixture of two drops, one being bounced back from a dead-end and stained red, and the other has remained blue.

The above thought experiment demonstrates that a medium can be used for parallel exploration or information processing if
- it can spread and propagate multiple paths in parallel and
- it can be broken up into the smallest drops with each carrying its own piece of information.
Water is a familiar medium we use every day but is far from ideal for the parallel computing jobs we hope to do. Physicists have better media to use: quantum waves. One big problem with water is that a water drop can always be divided into smaller ones, and we are never sure whether it is a combination of several smaller drops. Not only that, it loses liquidity quality when a drop gets down to the level of hundreds of molecules. In contrast, a drop of quantum wave is the smallest and cannot be divided. And the spreading or propagating quality is the same disregard to whether the wave contains one or more drops. If we can separate quantum waves into controllable drops with each carrying a piece of information, we may process the information carried by the drops in parallel. We call each drop of wave a quantum bit or qubit\index{qubit}.

\section{The quantum power}
As a matter of fact, all waves at low levels of energy or mass are quantum waves. Quantum physics tells us that all waves have their smallest drop or units -- the quanta\index{quantum}, which cannot get any smaller when measured by their energy or mass. Einstein was the first to hypothesize this nature of light and called the smallest unit light quantum. Before that, scientists had assumed the energy of a light could be dimmed as low as one wishes. Einstein's hypothesis has been proven true for all waves and is often called the particle nature of waves. What Einstein called a light quantum is called a photon by physicists today.

Einstein's discovery, a hypothesis at the time, might have something to do with his prior discovery, which equates mass with energy. Until then, all matter had mass and was composed of elementary particles such as electrons and nuclei. Einstein's revelation that light is also matter, which has only energy, is a precursor of the second revelation that all matter is fundamentally wave.

Bohr was the first to hypothesize electrons are waves. From Einstein and Bohr's hypothesis, the complete theory of quantum physics can be summarized by the particle and wave dual nature of matter:
- all matter is waves and
- each wave's energy or mass is an integer number of its smallest unit.
These two concepts are the essence of quantum physics. Quantum theory has been successfully applied to the invention and advancement of many modern technologies, including lasers and semiconductors. However, most of the lasers and semiconductor devices involve million to quadrillion photons or electrons. Even the tiniest transistor device in a modern semiconductor chip comprises at least thousands of electrons. Nevertheless, advances in modern technologies have gotten us to the level of working with light or electrons at the individual quantum level.

The idea of using quantum waves, with each quantum carrying a piece of information, to achieve parallel computing is not new. The publication of Deutch's algorithm\index{Deutsch's algorithm}\cite{1985Deutsch} in 1985 did not garner much attention. But the publication of Shor's algorithm\index{Shor's algorithm} in 1997, which may be considered an extension of Deutsch's, shocked the world with its potential power of factoring large numbers and consequently breaking modern encryption technologies.

The idea of applying quantum technology to secure communication came in 1984 with the publication of BB84 protocol\cite{BB84}. The idea is simple: using waves with one quantum of energy in each to transmit information. Since a wave of one quantum cannot be divided and therefore, it cannot be partially tapped for eavesdropping.

\caption{Wave arose from shaking or vibrating a string.}
\end{figure}

When talking about waves, we often visualize ripples in a lake or the surges in oceans and seas. We observe water being pushed up and then pulled down by gravity. If we shake one end of a string, as shown in Fig. \ref{String}, we can observe that each section of the string vibrates, and the vibration propagates from close to far. Vibration\index{vibration} in time and propagation\index{propagation} in space are the fundamental features of all waves. We can use frequency to characterize the vibration speed of a wave and amplitude or intensity to characterize the strength. But can we consider the vibration of a guitar string as a wave? Indeed, we can. The reason why we do not perceive propagation is that the propagation gets reflected back and forth by the two fixed ends of the string. Therefore, propagation remains a defining feature of waves, even if their propagation is constrained in spatial dimensions.

Quantum computing and communication use only electromagnetic waves, electron waves. Electromagnetic waves are the vibration of electric and magnetic fields. We are already familiar with radio waves and light waves used in Wi-Fi, cellular, cable, and optical fiber communications, as they are part of our daily lives. The reason that we do not see the particle or quantum nature of these waves is that their energy is typically quadrillions of a photon, and we only see the average effect. Getting down to the energy level of single photons, the wave parameters such as amplitude, phase, frequency, etc, used in these technologies to represent or carry information are also used in quantum computing and communication.

The wave nature of electrons is not obvious because they are trapped to small scales by atomic nuclei. J.J. Thomson discovered how they can be freed from the traps\cite{THOMSON} in a cathode ray tube (CRT). Freed electrons spread to an observable scale and demonstrate all the wave characteristics that physicists had associated with light waves. However, the vibration of an electron wave is not visible like that of a vibrating string or directly measurable like an electromagnetic wave. Physicists do find sufficient evidence of the vibration and have discovered it obeys the Schrödinger wave equation (Dirac equation if Einstein's special relativity is taken into account). Modern-day semiconductor and superconductor technologies could not be realized without the wave nature of electrons. However, they do not use electrons' wave parameters to carry information.

\subsection{Wave parameters}
In Fig. \ref{String}, the height of the rope at any location $x$ along its propagation direction and time $t$ may be described by a wave function $h(x,t)$. The simplest wave function is a sinusoidal function,
\begin{equation}\label{e-hWave1}
    h(x,t) = A sin[2\pi (\frac x \lambda - \frac t T) +\phi]
\end{equation}
where $A$ and $\lambda$ are, respectively, the amplitude and the wavelength, as shown in Fig. \ref{String}. $T$ and $\phi$ are the period and phase. Shown but not labeled in Fig. \ref{String} is the polarization of the vibration, which is in the $y$ direction and is perpendicular to the propagation direction. Fig. \ref{Wave} plots the height of the string vibration in the time dimension and is characterized by period and phase. All these parameters -- phase, wavelength, amplitude, period and polarization -- can be used to represent information. Worth noting, period, wavelength, and frequency are proportional or inversely proportional to each other. Using one is the same as using the others.

    \draw[dashed] (0.25,-0.1) -- (1,-2) node[below] {phase};
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Height of the string vibration in the time domain.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The particle nature}
Electrons are called particles for historical reasons. When they are trapped to the small scale of nuclei, they fit the image of point-like particles with negligible sizes and observable locations. This image is certainly wrong if they are freed from the trapping like what J.J. Thomson did in a cathode ray tube. The particle nature of matter should really be called the quantum nature of matter because it only means that the energy or mass of matter is an integer times some smallest units. How small a wave can be trapped or confined depends on its wavelength.

This narrowly defined particle or quantum nature is actually exhibited beyond the fundamental particles, e.g. photons, electrons and quarks. Scientists have found a collection of electrons in a superconductor vibrating across a Josephson junction have discrete energy values. Scientists call such a collection a pseudo particle. Qubits are easier to make from pseudo particles.

\subsection{The power of the dual nature}
It is the combination of the wave and particle natures that gives the power to quantum computing and communication:
- Any of the information representing wave parameters is a real number and, if not limited by noise, can carry as much information as the amount of real numbers, which is infinity.
- Many waves, which are coherent to each other, can be combined (or multiplexed in engineering term) as one wave for parallel processing.
- Having one quantum of energy or mass in a qubit determines at most one bit of information can be read out.

In theory, each of them can represent as information as there are real numbers. Quantum computing and communication technology is to separate and isolate waves with one quantum in each so that each can carry a separate piece of information. Each of the single quantum wave is a qubit. Appendix \ref{A-qubit} explains the physics behind some of the qubit separation and isolation techniques. But for ease of discussion, the rest of the book assumes qubits use light or electromagnetic waves.

\section{Constructing a quantum computer}
The computing unit of a quantum computer may use quantum waves to process information. However, other components of the computer still uses conventional computer hardware and software. And one interacts with the computer just like with any other computer. One even uses conventional languages such as Python to program the quantum computer. Only the portion of a program that requires parallel computing invokes a quantum circuit. For example, the following code starts by importing the class "QuantumCircuit" from package "qiskit" provided by IBM.
\begin{lstlisting}
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

c = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
c.h(0)
c.cx(0, 1)
c.measure(0, 0)
c.measure(1, 1)    
\end{lstlisting}
The code is the beginning portion of a program implementing the superdense protocol for encrypted communication illustrated in Fig. \ref{denseCoding}. It is a good example to show the essential components of a quantum system. Below explains the lines of the code:
\begin{itemize}
\item line 3 creates a quantum circuit object with 2 quantum registers and 2 conventional computer registers to store information; the registers are always initialized to be "0" upon creation;
\item line 4 connects the first quantum register labeled as "0" to an "H" quantum gate, which reads the information from the register, changes it, and puts the result back into the register;
\item line 5 connects the two quantum registers labeled as "0" and "1" to a "CX" quantum gate, which reads their information, changes it, and puts the result back into the registers;
\item line 6 connects the first quantum register to a "Measure" gate, which reads from the quantum register and outputs to the conventional register labeled as "0";
\item line 8 repeats the previous step for the second quantum and conventional registers.
\end{itemize}

In the standard von Neumann computer architecture, a register\index{register} is an information memory device; and a gate is an information processing device. A processing unit\index{processing unit} is a circuit connecting the two types of devices. A quantum processing unit also adheres to this von Neumann architecture. Fig. \ref{Circuit} is a quantum circuit diagram\index{quantum circuit diagram} implementing the above program. Each line in the diagram is a quantum register -- qubit whose wave parameters are initialized to represent zero. "H" and "CX" gates are drawn as rectangular boxes in the diagram. The gates, applied from left to right according to the sequence in the diagram, transform the waves in the qubits they connect to and thus process the information represented in the qubits. A double-line is a conventional register -- often a memory of one bit. A "Measure" gate reads the parameters of the wave in a qubit, and transfers the read information to a conventional memory depicted as a double line.

Despite being in Python, a high-level language, the code still calls on registers and gates like code in an assembly language, which programmers worked with 50 years ago. From the code and the circuit diagram, we see that the "CX" gate\index{CX gate} operates on two registers. As we will learn in subsequent chapters, we can construct gates to operate on any number of qubits in parallel. That is one source of the parallel computing power. A quantum gate can be made to operate on all qubits if their waves are synchronized and can be processed as a single wave.

\end{quantikz}
    \caption{Quantum circuit}
\end{figure}

We are probably puzzled by what the program achieves. Indeed, a programmer first needs to understand the problem before designing a solution. A quantum solution is typically described in a quantum circuit diagram for developers to implement as code. Most of this book is devoted to teaching how to design solutions by analyzing quantum algorithms, which are proven good solutions for particular types of problems.

\chapter{Using waves to represent information}\label{c-modulation}
When we get our blood pressure measured in a doctor's office, the nurse reads the height of the mercury in a glass column in millimeters. We see that a physical parameter is used to represent information. Information theory assumes all information\index{information} can be represented as numbers. For example, the information of a black-and-white picture is represented by the intensity numbers of all its pixels. Similarly, the information of a color picture can be represented by the sets of three numbers of its pixels. In this book, when we talk about information, we refer to the numbers. This chapter discusses how information can be represented or carried by waves in general, which has been studied extensively by communication scientists and engineers. Their knowledge, including their terminology, is mostly adopted by this book.

\section{Information, numbers and symbols}
In communication theory, the information-representing numbers are called symbols\index{symbol}. To transmit information, the numbers or symbols are mapped to carefully chosen parameters of electromagnetic waves. The information-carrying waves are called carrier waves\index{carrier wave}. Mapping information to numbers is called encoding\index{encoding}, and assigning numbers to wave parameters is called modulation\index{modulation}. The wave parameters to be assigned need to be carefully chosen to avoid noise and errors while maximizing the number of possible parameter points. More modulation points yield higher communication capacity. With the never-ending demand for increasing capacity, pursuing better and better modulation techniques is a never-ending field of study.

Radio broadcasts first used the amplitude of radio waves to represent the volume of one's voice. This is the so-called amplitude modulation (AM). The amplitude is the maximum of the vibrating electric field instead of the maximum height of the vibrating string shown in Fig. \ref{String}. Frequency modulation (FM) was later found less prone to noise than AM in the airways. To this day, we still have both AM and FM on the panels of our radios.

Modern radio communications, Wi-Fi and cellular, mostly use quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) -- a combination of amplitude modulation and phase modulation (PM). Modern optical fiber communication combines polarization modulation with phase modulation. Quantum communication and computing devices may adopt all the modulation schemes except amplitude modulation. In such a device, the wave has only one quantum of energy or mass, which fixes the value of the amplitude.

\section{Phase modulation}
In chapter \ref{c-intro}, the time delays of water drops traveling through the maze channels can be used to represent information i.e., the lengths of the channels. The phase of a wave reflects its relative time delay in propagation and can be used to represent information. Changing the phase value can be achieved by adding or subtracting the propagation path of the wave. Usually noted by symbol $\phi$, phase can take up any real number in the range [0, 2$\pi$). Phase modulation is used by all types of qubits, although it is always used in combination with polarization modulation (or equivalent).

\subsection{Graphical depiction}
In communication textbooks, amplitudes and phases of waves are paired as polar coordinates to plot the modulation points. Such a plot is called a constellation diagram. It gives us the most intuitive understanding of modulations. In phase modulation, the amplitude $A$ is a constant. The modulation points all fall on the circle of radius $A$ as shown in red in Fig. \ref{PM}.

%\node [constellation_cir] at (0,0) {};
\begin{figure}[h]\label{PM}

    \draw[->] (-3.5,0) -- (3.5, 0);

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Constellation diagram of phase modulation}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Mathematical notation}
We can use the polar coordinate $(A, \phi)$ as we do when plotting the constellation diagram in Fig. \ref{PM} to represent any modulation point. It can also be written in Cartesian coordinates as $(A cos\phi, A sin\phi)$ or as a complex number $A e^{i\phi}$.

\subsection{Digital modulation}
In the real world, each element in the communication channels and information processing devices can have noise and errors. We must select the modulation points sufficiently apart so that they are not obscured by noise and errors. Therefore, we can only use a finite number of modulation points to which only discrete integers can be mapped. This is what we call digital modulation. Modulations that can have real numbers mapped to are called analog modulations.

All computers use digital technology if we ignore the history of using the slide rule calculators. Even abacuses are digital calculators. Communication systems, however, are slow to convert to digital technology. That is because, for a long time, communication was about transmitting voice -- radio broadcasts and telephones, for which noise and errors could be tolerated. For digital information, modulations often carry different names, e.g., amplitude-shift keying (ASK), frequency-shift keying (FSK), and phase-shift keying, respectively (PSK).

\subsection{Capacity and Hartley's law}
For a communication channel, channel capacity is the maximum possible bits per second of a communication channel. If there are at most $M$ modulation points -- limited by noise and errors, only $M$ to the most possible symbols can be transmitted per time slot. That is $ln M$ bits of information. If the communication protocol divides each second into $R$ transmission time slots, Hartley's law gives the channel capacity to be
\begin{equation}
    C = R ln M.
\end{equation}
In theory, the maximum value of $R$ is the frequency of the carrier wave.

Channel capacity is a measure of communication channels. What is the capacity measure of computer memory devices? In conventional computers, the smallest unit of memory devices is standardized to be one bit. In quantum computers, the smallest memory device is a qubit. The number of modulation points $M$ depends on many factors. The amount of information that it stores is $ln M$ when measured in bits.

\subsection{Quadrature phase-shift keying}
Quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) is a digital phase modulation that demonstrates many principles used in quantum devices. It uses modulation points 90 degrees apart with their $\phi$. A simple choice is to use $\phi = 0, 90, 180$, and $270$ degrees and map them to 2-bit symbols -- 0, 1, 10, and 11 in binary. Fig-\ref{QPSK} is its constellation diagram.

\begin{figure}[h]\label{QPSK}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[->] (-3.5,0) -- (3.5, 0);
    \draw[->] (0,-3.5) -- (0,3.5);

\end{tikzpicture}

\caption{QPSK constellation diagram}
\end{figure}

Communication engineers call the wave with zero degree phase the quadrature wave and the one with $90^\circ$ phase the in-phase wave. They have these properties:
\begin{enumerate}\label{l-Hilbert}
    \item they have zero overlap and thus maximum distinguish-ability during measurement;
\item can be composed or mixed to become a wave with any phase $\phi$
\item a wave with any phase $\phi$ can be decomposed into them.
\end{enumerate}

Zero overlap results in zero probability of mistaking one wave with another during measurement. In mathematics, the two wave functions are orthogonal to each other. Decomposition means, the wave function in Eq. \ref{e-hWave} becomes
\begin{equation}\label{e-hWave}
    h(x,t) = A cos\phi sin[2\pi (\frac x \lambda - \frac t T)] + A sin\phi cos[2\pi (\frac x \lambda - \frac t T)].
\end{equation}
Composition is the reverse of this, of course. It is easy to prove that any two waves with phases $90^\circ$ apart have these three properties. According to functional analysis, a modern branch of mathematics, wave functions of the same amplitude $A$ but different phases belong to a Hilbert space. Any two wave functions with phases $90^\circ$ apart form the bases of the Hilbert space and have the properties listed in \ref{l-Hilbert}.

\subsection{Symmetric QPSK and demodulation}
For simpler modulator and demodulator circuitry, the symmetric QPSK modulation scheme shown in the constellation diagram Fig. \ref{sQPSK} is more widely used in practice. The modulation points are $\phi = 45, 135, 225$ and $315$ degrees.

\section{Polarization modulation}
For an electromagnetic wave, the vibration of its electric field is always perpendicular to its direction of propagation, as shown in Fig. \ref{Polarization}, just like the vibration of a string. The polarization can be characterized by the angle of the vibration $\theta$ as shown in Fig. \ref{PolarM}.

In modern optical fiber and free space communication, polarization modulation\index{polarization modulation} is used in combination with phase modulation. The digital scheme, dual-polarization quadrature phase shift keying\index{dual-polarization quadrature phase shift keying} (DP-QPSK\index{DP-QPSK}), in particular, is mostly used. Optical fiber communication is the backbone of all our daily communication. Free-space communication, on the other hand, is mostly used in earth-satellite and satellite-satellite communication.

Quantum communication experiments and trials have been conducted so far through optical fibers or in free space. Information has all been represented in qubits by a combination of phase modulation and polarization modulation of optical waves. In Appendix \ref{A-qubit}, we show that the modulation in all types of qubits is a combination of phase modulation plus modulation of a wave parameter mathematically equivalent to polarization modulation.

As with phase modulation, any two waves whose polarizations are orthogonal to each other have zero overlap and are least prone to noise and errors during measurement. We usually use $\theta$ to note the angle of the polarization relative to the horizontal plane. $\theta$ is between $0^\circ$ and $180^\circ$. As with phase, another significance of two waves of orthogonal polarizations is that their superposition or mixture can produce a wave of polarization of any angle. For example, mixing $cos\theta$ portion of the wave with horizontal polarization and $sin\theta$ portion of the wave of vertical polarization produces a wave of phase $\phi$. 

\subsection{Graphical depiction}
We can replace $\phi$ with $\theta$ to draw a 2-D constellation diagram to depict polarization modulation intuitively. Fig. \ref{DP-QPSK} shows the modulation points of a double polarization modulation scheme. But how can we graphically depict a modulation combining two parameters, $\theta$, and $\phi$? We can use the spherical coordinate $(A, \theta, \phi)$ to show the modulation points as shown in Fig. \ref{DP-QPSK} for DP-QPSK.

Engineers usually do not use diagrams to depict modulations involving parameters other than phase and amplitude. However, physicists use a Bloch diagram to show the spin and phase of an electron wave. Spin is the polarization of an electron wave. In a Bloch diagram, the amplitude $A$ is always 1.

\subsection{Algebraic notation}
As we described in the previous section, the modulation point of a wave can be noted using the spherical coordinate $(A, \theta, \phi)$, which relates directly to the physical parameters of the carrier wave. Another notation is the complex Cartesian coordinate $(Acos\theta, Ae^{i\phi} sin\theta )$. And we can consider $Acos\theta$ representing the horizontal polarization component of the wave and $Ae^{i\phi} sin\theta$ representing the vertical component. Then $\phi$ is the phase of the vertical component relative to the horizontal component. If we consider both of their phases relative to a certain reference wave, we can use a complex Cartesian coordinate $(Ae^{i\phi_0} cos\theta, Ae^{i\phi_1} sin\theta )$ to represent the two components of the wave. Physicists like to use a complex number pair $(x_0, x_1)$, where $x_0 = Ae^{i\phi_0} cos\theta$ and $x_1 = Ae^{i\phi_1} sin\theta$, to note the wave.

\chapter{Quantum information}\label{c-qinfo}
In the previous chapter, we studied how information can be represented or carried by waves using different modulation schemes. All the modulation schemes, if not involving amplitude modulation, apply to qubits. Amplitude modulation is excluded because each qubit has only one quantum of energy and its amplitude, which is proportional to the square root of the energy, cannot be changed to represent different information values.

\section{Qubit modulation}
A qubit can carry as much information as limited by noise and errors. However, a qubit has one quantum of energy and only be measured once. Therefore, information read-out from a qubit may be limited. This chapter studies how the measurement limitation determines the modulation points that can be used or best used by qubits. Of course, qubits with only one quantum of energy or mass in each are even more vulnerable to noise and errors. Error correction is a very important subject under research studies, but is not a subject of this book.

\section{Measurable waves}
Measuring a qubit is an attempt to read the information carried by the wave into a conventional memory device, which uses electrical voltage or current to represent information. As shown in Fig. \ref{Demodulator-DP2}, a DP-QPSK demodulator for optical fiber communication splits the received input wave into four equal but orthogonal waves to be resonated with the four equal portions of a locally generated wave. Four photodetectors convert the optical energy of the four resonances to electric signal currents.

To measure a qubit, the wave is split into two waves of orthogonal polarizations as shown in Fig. \ref{Demodulator-QP} before bringing them to resonate with the electrons in two single-photon detectors in the $M$ boxes. There is no locally generated wave. Because we have no knowledge of the phases of the electron waves, we cannot measure the phase $phi$ of the input qubit wave. Further, because the qubit has only one photon and only one of the detectors produces photo-current, we cannot measure the polarization $\theta$ of the qubit wave either unless we know in advance that its polarization is either zero or $90$ degree. This is the fundamental limit of qubit measurement: only up to one bit of information can be extracted from a qubit.

\section{Qubit modulation}
\subsection{Mostly used modulation points}
The mostly used modulation points of a single qubit have $\theta$ equals to $0, 90, 45, and -45$ as shown in Fig. \ref{qQPSK}. In ket notion, they are $\keta{0}$, $\keta{1}$, $\keta{+}$ and $\keta{-}$. They can be used to encode binary data 00, 01, 10, and 11.

\begin{figure}[h]\label{qQPSK}
%\includegraphics[width=6cm]{pic/qqpsk.jpg}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[->] (-3.5,0) -- (3.5, 0);

    \draw[dashed] (2.5,2.5) -- (0,0);
    \draw[dashed] (0,0) -- (2.5,-2.5);
    \draw[dotted, red] (0,0) circle(3cm);
    \draw[red, fill] (3,0) circle(0.05cm) node[below right] {\ket{0} - 00};

    \draw[red, fill] (2.12,-2.12) circle(0.05cm) node[below] {\ket{-} - 10};
    \draw[dashed] (1,0) arc (0:45:1) node[right, pos=0.6]{$\theta=\pi/4$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Constenlation diagram of quantum $\theta$ shift keying}
\end{figure}

From the previous chapter, we understand that information carried by a wave in a qubit can be described by a pair of real numbers $(\theta, \phi)$ in the polar coordinate or a pair of complex numbers $(x_0, x_1)$ where $|x_0|^2 + |x_1|^2 = 1$. Polar coordinates are best for visualizing modulation points graphically, which all fall on the sphere in Fig. \ref{DP-QPSK}. The sphere is called the Block sphere by physicists.

\subsection{Tensor notation}
The complex number pair notation $(x_0, x_1)$ is easier to use when studying a quantum gate transforming a qubit from one modulation point to another, say $(x'_0, x'_1)$. Physicists usually use the transpose of the complex coordinates, which are tensors. So, we can write a transformation as a matrix multiplying the transposed tensor of the original coordinate:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{pmatrix}
    x'_0 \\
    x'_1
\end{pmatrix}
=
    \begin{pmatrix}
    t_{0,0} & t_{0,1} \\
    t_{1,0} & t_{1,1} 
\end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
    x_0 \\
    x_1
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
Here, the matrix
\begin{equation}\label{e-T}
T
=
    \begin{pmatrix}
    t_{0,0} & t_{0,1} \\
    t_{1,0} & t_{1,1} 
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
is the transformation matrix representing the gate.

\subsection{Ket notation}
Physicists favor what is called the ket notation, which actually is a vector notation. The unit vectors $\hat x_0$ and $\hat x_1$ are written as $\keta{0}$ and $\keta{1}$. Therefore, a modulation point can be written as $cos{\theta} \keta{0} + e^{i \phi} sin{\theta} \keta{1}$ or $x_0 \keta{0} + x_1 \keta{1}$. Here, the "$+$" is mathematically a vector addition. Physicists interpret the "$+$" as superposition -- coherent mixing or addition of two waves.

The ket notation provides physicists with a brief notation along with associated physical meaning. In the ket notation, transformations of quantum gates are written as abstract operators. So, the ket notation is best for theoretical derivation but not for numerical calculation. Its advantage is also in describing a circuit of $n$-qubits, as we will see soon.

\section{Qubit transformation and gates}\label{Sec-Plus}
A qubit is always assumed to be at the modulation point of $\keta{0}$. Signle-qubit quantum gates are to transform it to other modulation points. Even the measurable $\keta{1}$ point is transformed from it by an $X$ gate\index{X gate}.

\subsection{$X$, $Y$ and $Z$  gates}
In a $\theta$ constellation diagram, an $X$ gate swaps the $x$ and $y$ axes or is a 2-D reflection across the $45^\circ$ line. In vector notation, the transformation of an $X$ gate is expressed as a matrix,
\begin{equation}
    X = \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & 1 \\
        1 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
In a circuit diagram, an $X$ gate is the letter $X$ in a box. Therefore, the transformation from $\keta{0}$ to $\keta{1}$ can be drawn as
\begin{figure}[h]\label{X1}
\begin{quantikz}
    \lstick{\ket{0}} & \gate{X} & \qw \rstick{\ket{1}}
\end{quantikz}
\caption{Use X gate to produce a $\keta{1}$ wave.}
\end{figure}

An $X$ gate can also be represented as $\bigoplus$. However, in this book, we do not use this notation.

Beside the $X$ gate, literatures also talk about Pauli $Y$ and $Z$ gates, which transform a qubit according to the Pauli matrices\index{Pauli matrices}:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rl}
    Y & = \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & -i \\
        i & 0
    \end{pmatrix} \\
    Z & = \sigma_z = \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 0 \\
        0 & -1
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Hadamard gate}
A Hadamard gate can be viewed as a reflection transform across the $\theta= 22.5^{\circ}, \phi=0^{\circ} $ axis as shown in Fig. \ref{qQPSK}. Its circuit symbol is the letter "H" enclosed in a square. Reflecting a $\keta{0}$ modulation point across the axis obviously becomes a qubit of $45^\circ$ polarization -- the $\keta{+}$ state. And reflecting the $\keta{1}$ qubit across the axis becomes a qubit of $-45^\circ$ polarization -- the $\keta{-}$ state.

\section{BB84 protocol}
Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard proposed in 1984 a quantum encryption protocol\cite{BB84}. Fundamentally, it is a realization of the classical one-time pad (OTP) protocol and is not practical for encryption. However, it may be used for cipher key distribution. Moreover, it is a good illustration of quantum communication principles.

\subsection{BB84 as an encryption protocol}
By tradition, all communication encryption protocols are narrated as the scenario that Alice wants to transmit a series of data bits to Bob but fears Eve may eavesdrop the communication channel\cite{Schneier}. The protocol assumes:
- Alice has a series of data bits to be encrypted; she also has another series of encryption key bits, which are random;
- Bob has the same series of key bits but expects to receive the data bits encrypted.

In each time slot, the protocol goes through the following steps to transmit one data bit:
- Alice takes one bit from each series to form a 2-bit symbol -- the first bit from the data series and the second from the key series;
- This step can be stated in two versions: from a physicist's perspective, Alice encodes the data bit to the $\beta{0}$, $\beta{1}$ modulation points; if the key bit is 1, she rotates the polarization of the modulation point by $45^\circ$; from an engineer's perspective, Alice encodes the 2-bit symbol, 00, 01, 10 or 11, to the $\beta{0}$, $\beta{1}$, $\beta{-}$ or $\beta{+}$ modulation point;
- Alice sends the qubit to Bob;
- How Bob recovers the data bit can have two versions of explanation: from a physicist's perspective, Bob rotates the wave's polarization by $-45^\circ$ if the key bit is 1; from an engineer's perspective, the key bit value determines whether to apply a Hadamard gate as shown in the circuit diagram \ref{BB84}.

\end{quantikz}

\end{figure}

Performance
Qubits per channel: one qubit
Channel capacity: one data bit per transmission time slot
Channel efficiency: 50\%.

From a cryptographer's perspective, the protocol has two problems:
- it is subjected to intercept-resend attack by Eve -- Bob cannot tell whether a symbol received is a re-send from Eve after intercepting the original;
- it is a one-time-pad encryption, and the key length must be as long as the data bit length. How can Alice share the key bits with Bob in the first place? It is a chicken-and-egg dilemma.

The first problem can be addressed by adding authentication bits to the data bits.

\subsection{Adding authentication to BB84 protocol}
To address the vulnerability that Eve may intercept the qubits from Alice and sends Bob qubits produced by herself, the standard cryptography approach of adding authentication bits may be adopted. That is, to every $n$ data bits, $m$ authentication bits known to both Alice and Bob are added: $a_1 a_2 ... a_m d_1 d_2 ...d_n$. If Bob finds the authentication bits not being what he expects, he discards the block of $m+n$ bits.

\subsection{Key distribution}
The second problem with BB84 has no solution. But instead of using it for encryption, we can use the protocol for key distribution. For key distribution, Alice sends Bob a series of random bits. If some of the bits are tossed out randomly, the remaining bits received by Bob are still a series of random bits and can still be used as encryption keys.

The BB84 encryption protocol is modified for key distribution in the following way:
- Alice generates two blocks of random bits of equal length. Instead of data bits, the first block is for candidate key bits.
- Alice pairs the bits from the two blocks and sends them to Bob in the quantum channel (the qubit). Each pair is mapped to the modulation points shown in Fig. \ref{qQPSK}.
- Bob does not have the encryption key bits that Alice uses but a series of key bits from his random generation. Bob demodulates each received qubit using his key bit and obtains his candidate key bits.
- Alice and Bob then use a conventional communication channel to compare their corresponding key bits. If they agree, Alice and Bob keep the candidate data bit. Otherwise, the candidate bit is discarded.

With 50\% candidate key bits discarded, only 25\% of the bits transmitted from Alice to Bob can be used as keys for future encryption. Therefore, the efficiency of BB84 key distribution protocol is 25\%.

\section{Deutsch's algorithm}
A binary function $f$ that maps \{0,1\} -\> \{0,1\} may have 4 possible results, which are 2 bits of information. With a conventional computer, it'd take 2 bits of memory and 2 operations to calculate the results. With a quantum wave, one qubit and one operation is possible:
\begin{equation}
    U_f(\keta{+}) = \frac 1 {\sqrt 2} [(-1)^{f(0)} \keta{0} + (i)^{f(1)} \keta{1}].
\end{equation}
The operation uses the results of $f(0)$ and $f(1)$ to change respectively the polarization and the phase depending of the quantum wave. The transformation matrix
\begin{equation}
    U = \begin{pmatrix}
        (-1)^{f(0)} & 0 \\
        0 & (i)^{f(1)}
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}

Deutsch's algorithm is to derive the function type of $f(x)$ instead of its values. A function has two types, constant and balanced. A constant function type means $f(1)=f(0)$, and a balanced type means $f(1)\neq f(0)$. The type of a function is one-bit information and can be determined by calculating $|f(1)-f(0)|$, which is either 0 or 1. A quantum computing algorithm is to feed the function with the $\keta{+}$ qubit:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rl}
    U_f(\keta{+}) = & \frac 1 {\sqrt 2} [(-1)^{f(0)} \keta{0}+ (-1)^{f(1)} \keta{1}] \\
    = & \frac 1 {\sqrt 2} (-1)^{f(0)} [\keta{0}+ (-1)^{f(1)-f(0)} \keta{1}].
\end{array}
\end{equation}
The transformation matrix
\begin{equation}
    U = \begin{pmatrix}
        (-1)^{f(0)} & 0 \\
        0 & (-1)^{f(1)}
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}

\chapter{Qubit Multiplexing}\label{c-qubitMultiplexing}
The smallest information-carrying unit of a conventional computer is a bit stored in a pair of transistors. From there, 8, 16, 32, or 64 bits are used together as units like a byte, INT16, INT32, or FLOAT for processing. All these units are of fixed sizes. The advantage of graphics processing units (GPU)\index{GPU} lies in their capability to process in parallel such units of multiple bits.

In a Wi-Fi communication channel, the smallest information carrier is called a carrier or sub-carrier, which is a wave at a particular frequency. To increase capacity, several sub-carriers at different frequencies are combined in a channel to transmit in the same medium i.e. the radio airway. The sub-carriers must have frequencies sufficiently separated so that the receiver can distinguish them. How many sub-carriers can be squeezed in the same channel and how to combine them so that the sub-carriers can be maximally distinguished at the receiver is an area of study called multiplexing by communication engineers.

For quantum computing, we certainly need to multiplex qubits to achieve parallel processing. However, there is another use - to overcome the measurement limitation of quantum waves. As we explained in the previous chapter, a qubit can carry more than one bit of information, but measurement can only extract one bit at most. If a qubit carries $n$-bit information, can we put it into the mix of $n$ qubits through multiplexing so that the information can be distributed among the qubits for measurement? The answer is yes. And this chapter explains how multiplexing serves both purposes.

\section{Measurable waves and superpositions}
In the previous chapter, we label the measurable waves of a qubit with $0$ and $1$ and note the corresponding wave functions as $\keta{s}$, where $s=0, 1$. Naturally, we label the measurable waves of $n$ qubits with $(s_1, s_2, ..., s_n)$ where $i=1, 2, ...n$ and note their wave functions in the ket notation as
\begin{equation}\label{e-nqubit}
    \keta{s_1, s_2, ..., s_n} or
    \keta{s_1} \keta{s_2} ... \keta{s_n}
\end{equation}
where $s_i = 0, 1$ and $i=1, 2, ..., n$.

Similar to the wave functions of a single qubit, the wave functions in Eq. \ref{e-nqubit} are the base vectors of a $2^n$-dimensional Hilbert space. $n$-qubit modulation points are superpositions of the bases:
\begin{equation}
    \keta{w} = \sum_{s_1=0,0; s_2=0,1; ...; s_n=0,1} x_{s_1, s_2, ..., s_n} \keta{s_1, s_2, ..., s_n}.
\end{equation}
To satisfy normalization condition,
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{s_1=0,0; s_2=0,1; ...; s_n=0,1} |x_{s_1, s_2, ..., s_n}|^2 =1.
\end{equation}
A modulation point can also be represented in a tuple notation or matrix notation. But the ket notation is most popular.

When multiplexing multiple qubits, their waves remain physically separated or can be separated from each other. But their phases are synchronized so that they can be processed by a quantum gate as one wave.

\subsection{Entangled states}
If none of the $n$ qubit waves in a superposition is measurable, the superposition is called an entangled state.

\section{Mostly used 2-qubit modulation points}
Other than the measurable waves, $\keta{0}\keta{0}$, $\keta{0}\keta{1}$, $\keta{1}\keta{0})$, and $\keta{1}\keta{1})$, the mostly used waves or modulation points are the so called Bell states, which are named after John Bell. 

\subsection{Bell states}
Bell states are superpositions of selected pairs of the base waves:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rl}
    \keta{B_{00}} =& \frac 1 {\sqrt 2} (\keta{0}\keta{0}+\keta{1}\keta{1}),\\
    \keta{B_{01}} =& \frac 1 {\sqrt 2} (\keta{0}\keta{1}+\keta{1}\keta{0}),\\
    \keta{B_{10}} =& \frac 1 {\sqrt 2} (\keta{0}\keta{0}-\keta{1}\keta{1}),\\
    \keta{B_{11}} =& \frac 1 {\sqrt 2} (\keta{0}\keta{1}-\keta{1}\keta{0}).
\end{array}
\end{equation}
They are orthogonal to each other. And each is an entangled state.

We can use the 8 waves from the 2 sets of bases to represent numbers of 3 bits as shown in Fig. \ref{2qQPSK}.
\begin{figure}\label{2qQPSK}

    \draw[->] (-3.5,0) -- (3.5, 0);

\end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{2 qubit base states and Bell states}
\end{figure}


\section{Mostly used modulation points}
\subsection{Measurement bases}
The measurement base waves are $\keta{x_0}\keta{x_1}\keta{x_2} ...\keta{x_{n-1}}=\prod^{n-1}_{i=0}$, where $x_i in \{0, 1\}$.

\subsection{Evenly mixed wave and Fourier bases}
Expanding on the idea of the $\keta{+}$ wave in \ref{Sec-Plus}, we can have a wave
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rl}
    \keta{e_n} &= \frac 1 {\sqrt{2}} (\keta[0]{0}+\keta[0]{1}) \frac 1 {\sqrt{2}} (\keta[1]{0}+\keta[1]{1})
    ... \frac 1 {\sqrt{2}} (\keta[n-1]{0}+\keta[n-1]{1}) \\
    &= \frac 1 {2^{n/2}} (\keta{b_0}+\keta{b_1}+...+\keta{b_{N-1}})
 \end{array}
\end{equation}
which is an evenly mixture of the $n$-qubit bases. But what are the orthogonal waves similar to the $\keta{-}$ of one qubit?
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rl}
\keta{s_k} &= \frac 1 {\sqrt{2}} ({\keta{0}}_0+{\keta{1}}_0)
    \frac 1 {\sqrt{2}} ({\keta{0}}_1+e^{\frac {k*2 \pi i} 2}{\keta{1}}_1)
    ...  \frac 1 {\sqrt{2}} ({\keta{0}}_{n-1}+e^{\frac {(n-1)*2\pi i} 2^(n-1)}{\keta{1}}_{n-1}) \\
    ... \\
    &= \frac 1 {\sqrt{N}} \prod^{n-1}_{l=0} ({\keta{0}}_l+e^{\frac {k\times l \times 2\pi i} 2^l}{\keta{1}}_l) where k=0, 1, ...N-1.
\end{array}
\end{equation}
Like the $\keta{+}$ and $\keta{-}$ waves, each of the $\{\keta{s_k}, k=0, 1, ... N-1\}$ waves is a mixture of all the base waves, but they have different orientations in the $N$ dimension Hilbert space.

\subsection{Producing equal superposition}

\section{Quantum gates for information processing}
Qubits are memory devices or communication channels. Quantum gates are processing devices that can change the modulation of $\theta$ and phase $\phi$. As desired by the algorithms, the gates are concatenated or connected into circuits. Other than measuring gates, no gate changes the amplitude of the qubits in a circuit. Therefore, all gate transformations are unitary and can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
G=
    \begin{pmatrix}
        cos\delta \theta & -e^{i\delta \lambda} sin\delta \theta \\
        e^{i \delta \phi} sin\delta \theta & e^{i \delta \phi+ \delta \lambda} cos\theta 
    \end{pmatrix} or
G=   \begin{pmatrix}
        g_{00} & g_{01} \\
        g_{10} & g_{11} 
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
where $G^\dagger = G$

\subsection{Control gates}
Cleve etal\cite{Cleve_1998} proposed what is called control-$f$ gate to build the function $f(x)$ into a quantum gate.
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{quantikz}[scale=1.3]
    \lstick{\ket{x}} & \qwbundle{n} & \ctrl{1}  & \qwbundle{n} \rstick{\ket{x}} \\
    \lstick{\ket{y}} & \qw           & \gate{f} &\qw \rstick{\ket{y\bigoplus f(x)}}
\end{quantikz}
\caption{Control-f gate}
\label{ctrl_f}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Control gates}
Assume $f(x)$ is a binary function mapping $x \in {0,1}$ to ${0,1}$. The control-f gate takes input waves $\keta{x}\keta{y}$, where $x$ and $y$ are either 0 or 1, and produce the output waves as shown below.
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{quantikz}
    \lstick{\ket{x}}  & \ctrl{1}  & \qw \rstick{\ket{x}} \\
    \lstick{\ket{y}} & \gate{f} &\qw \rstick{\ket{y\bigoplus f(x)}}
\end{quantikz}
\caption{Control-f gate}
\label{c-f}
\end{figure}
A particularly important type of control gates is the control-NOT or C-NOT gates, in which the $f$ is the Pauli $X$. A C-NOT gate is best described in vector notation as matrix
\begin{equation}
    \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 &0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 &0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Gates to produce Bell states}
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{quantikz}
    \lstick{\ket{+}}  & \ctrl{1} & \qw \rstick[2]{\ket{\Phi^+}} \\
    \lstick{\ket{0}} & \gate{X} &\qw 
\end{quantikz}
\caption{Producing Bell states}
\label{BS}
\end{figure}
Changing the input waves from $\keta{+}$ to $\keta{-}$ or from $\keta{0}$ to $\keta{1}$, we can obtain the other Bell states.

\section{Circuit diagrams}
A algorithm or protocol is always depicted by a circuit diagram or series of matrix calculations. In circuit diagram, a qubit is shown as a line, and a gate as a rectangle.

\chapter{Quantum Communication Protocols}\label{c-comm}
Encryption is used in everyday Internet communication. Encryption conceals the credit card numbers and passwords, which we send to the e-commerce websites. But we don't know whether or not the communication is being tapped for eavesdropping. In fact, our communications with international parties are routinely tapped and monitored by various national security agencies.

The significant use of quantum technology in communication is its anti-eavesdropping feature. If a communication carrier is a qubit, which has a wave of only one quantum, partial tapping is impossible. Eavesdropping can only be accomplished by intercepting the qubit. Further, the eavesdropper may attempt to clone the intercepted qubit and transmit the clone to the receiver to avoid detection. In this chapter, we discuss how quantum communication protocols can be designed to overcome the security challenges.

\section{Superdense coding}
Superdense coding is also called dense coding. It can be used as a communication encryption protocol. Like the BB84 protocol, it takes advantage of the fact that a qubit can be modulated in each transmission time slot to carry 2-bit information, which cannot be extracted by any eavesdropper. Instead of the assistance of a classical channel as in BB84, it extracts the 2 bits at the receiving end with the assistance of a second qubit entangled with the first.

As shown in the circuit diagram Fig. \ref{denseCoding}, the operation first entangles the qubit in Alice' possession remotely with the one possessed by Bob into $\keta{B_00}$. Alice modulates her qubit with the $X$ and $Z$ gates according to two input bits before passing the qubit to Bob. The resulting state of the qubits changes among the Bell states as shown in Table \ref{t-DenseCoding}. Bob then de-entangles the two qubits before measuring the qubits to extract the two bits.

\end{figure}

The protocol uses 3 qubits. The second is shared between Alice and Bob and is entangled with the third, which is solely possessed by Bob, at the first stage. Alice modulates the first qubit with an analog signal encoded as a pair of complex numbers $(x, y)$. The state of the qubit may be written as $x \keta{0} + y\keta{1}$. Alice de-entangle it with the 2nd before measuring them.

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rl}
\keta{\Phi_1}
    = & (x \keta{0} + y\keta{1}) \frac 1 {\sqrt 2}(\keta{0}\keta{0}+\keta{1}\keta{1}) \\
    = & \frac 1 {\sqrt 2} (\keta{0}\keta{0}+\keta{1}\keta{1}) (x \keta{0} + y\keta{1}) \\
    +& \frac 1 {\sqrt 2} (\keta{0}\keta{0}-\keta{1}\keta{1}) (x \keta{0} - y\keta{1})  \\

    +& \keta{B_{01}} (x \keta{0} + y\keta{1}) \\
    & \keta{B_{10}} (x \keta{0} - y\keta{1}) \\
    +& \keta{B_{11}} (x \keta{0} - y\keta{1})
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}

\keta{\Phi_2}
    = & \keta{0} \keta{0} (x \keta{0} + y\keta{1}) \\
    +& \keta{0} \keta{1} (x \keta{0} + y\keta{1}) \\
    + & \keta{1} \keta{0}  (x \keta{0} - y\keta{1}) \\
    +& \keta{1} \keta{1} (x \keta{0} - y\keta{1})
\end{array}
\end{equation}

The first qubit is never shared with Bob, and the third is never shared with Alice. Yet, the analog information $(x, y)$ carried by the first can be passed onto the third. Depending on Alice' measurement output, which is passed on to Bob by a classical channel, Bob can determine the wave function of the third qubit:
\begin{table}[]
\label{TeleportationTable}
\begin{tabular}{lr}

00 & $x\keta{0}+y\keta{1}$ \\

10 & $x\keta{0}-y\keta{1}$  \\
11 & $x\keta{1}-y\keta{0}$

With the help of a C-NOT gate, the 2 bits of information modulated in one qubit can be transfered to two qubits and therefore can be all extracted.
\subsection{Quantum Fourier transform}
Classical discrete Fourier transform maps a set of $N$ complex numbers ${x_0, x_1, ..., x_{N-1}}$ to another $N$ complex numbers
\begin{equation}
    y_k = \frac 1 {\sqrt{N}} \sum^{N-1}_{n=0} x_n\omega_{N}^{-nk}, k = 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1,
\end{equation}
where $w_N = e^{\frac {2\pi i} N }$. For physicists and engineers, the numbers ${y_n}$ help to reflect prominently the periodic patterns such as their frequency in $x_n$. For the same purpose, quantum Fourier transform is defined mathematically as follow but is easier to be realized by quantum gates:
\begin{equation}
    y_k = \frac 1 {\sqrt{N}} \sum^{N-1}_{n=0} x_n\omega_{N}^{xk}, k = 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1,
\end{equation}
where $x = x_0 + x_1 2^1 + x_2 2^2 + ... +x_{N-1} 2^{N-1}$. In vector notation, $F_N$ is a unitary matrix, and its $i, j$ element is
\begin{equation}
    f_{i,j} = \omega^{i.j}.
\end{equation}
This matrix is the same matrix as for the discrete Fourier transform. Therefore, quantum Fourier transform is equivalent to discrete Fourier transform.

\section{Shor's algorithm}
Almost all Internet connections from our mobile phones and computers are based on AES, a private key encryption algorithm. To establish the key to be used, a public-key algorithm is used for key exchange. The standard public-key algorithms, RSA and DH algorithms are all based on the difficulty of factoring large integer numbers. Factoring 15 = 3x5 is easy for a person. Factoring 12140041 = 3413x3557 is impossible for a person. The key exchange used in Internet depends on factoring bigger numbers that are difficult for modern-day computers.

For a positive integer $M$, how can we find out whether it has factors? The naive brute force approach is to iterate over $a=2, 3, ..., [M/2]$ one by one to see whether $M$ modulo $a$ is zero or $M \mod a = 0$. The needed operation is $[M/2]$. Mathematicians have found a shortcut basing on the fact that if a pair of positive integers $a < N$ and even number $r$ exist, such that $a^r = 1(\mod M)$, $M$ can be factored. And at least $a^{r/2}+1)$ and $(a^{r/2}-1)$ are the factors. $r$ is called the order of $a$. The ranges of $a$ and $r$ are much smaller than $[M/2]$. But, besides some trivial solutions, iterating over all the possible $a$ and $r$ is still daunting. Peter Shor, in his 1997 monumental paper\cite{1997Shor}, described a quantum algorithm that finds the existence of $r$ and its value without iteration for every given $a$.

Assume $n = [ln(M)]$ and $N=2^n$ and $f(x) = a^x (Mod M)$. The ideas behind Deutsch's algorithm can be extended to $n$ dimension:$f(x) = a^x (Mod M)$
1. feed the function $f(x) = a^x (Mod M)$ with the evenly mixed quantum waves $\keta{e_n}$
2. use phase kickback to transfer the values of $f(j), j\in \{0,N-1\}$, which should have periodicity of $r$, to the phases of the waves in the Fourier base
3. use phase estimate to reveal the information containing $r$.

For phase kickback to work, we need to find an eigen-waves of $U_f$,
\begin{equation}\label{keta_u}
    \keta{u} = \sum^{r-1}_{j=0} c_j \keta{a^j (\mod M)}.
\end{equation}
If we assume the eigen-values are $e^{2\pi i \frac k r}$ where $k=0, 1, 2, ..., r-1$. We derive the corresponding eigen-waves to be
\begin{equation}\label{keta_uk}
    \keta{u_k} = \frac 1 {\sqrt{r}} \sum^{r-1}_{j=0} e^{-{\frac {2\pi} r} kj} \keta{a^j (mod M)}
\end{equation}

However, we don't know the value of $r$ at the first place except the trivial $u_0$. How can we produce any of the non-trivial eigen waves to feed the operator $U_f$? Fortunately, the even mixture of the eigen waves
\begin{equation}\label{sum_u}
    \frac 1 {\sqrt{r}} \sum^{r-1}_{k=0}\keta{u_k} = \frac 1 r \sum^{r-1}_{k=0} \sum^{r-1}_{j=0} e^{-{\frac {2\pi} r} kj} \keta{a^j (mod M)} = \sum^{r-1}_{j=0} \delta_j,0 \keta{a^j (mod M)} = \keta{1}
\end{equation}
is a wave that we know how to produce. Feed it to the control-$U_f$ with $j$ being the control-variable value, we have
\begin{equation}\label{ctrl_u}
\begin{array}{rl}
 \sum^{N-1}_{j=0} \keta{j} \keta{1} \xrightarrow{U_{f(j)}} & \sum^{N-1}_{j=0} \keta{j} U_{f(j)} \frac 1 {\sqrt{r}} \sum^{r-1}_{k=0}\keta{u_k}\\
    = & \frac 1 {\sqrt{r}} \sum^{r-1}_{k=0} \sum^{N-1}_{j=0} \keta{j} e^{2\pi i \frac kj r} \keta{u_k}\\
    = & \frac 1 {\sqrt{r}} \sum^{r-1}_{k=0} \keta{s_{k/r}} \keta{u_k}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\section{Grover's algorithm}
Like the Deutsch's algorithm, the Grover's algorithm also assumes a blackbox function $f(x)$ whose variable $x$ is a $n$-bit binary variable while its result is almost always 1 except at a few unknown points $x=x_w$. We assume $f(x_w)=-1$ at these exceptions. The goal of the algorithm is to find the $x_w$. Lov Grover proposed in 1996 that quantum computer can solve it faster than conventional computers.

To illustrate the algorithm, assume there is one and only one $x_w$ which is the search solution. Let's note $x_w$ in binary as $w_{n-1}...w_i...w_1 w_0$ where $w_i = 0 or 1$,
and $\Vec{w} = (0, 0, ..., 1 at i=w, ..., 0)^T$ as a $2^n-1$ dimensional vector.

Using conventional computers, the naive algorithm is to feed the $2^n -1$ possible numbers of $x_w$ one at a time to $f$ to test whether the result equals $-1$. It is a brute force algorithm. The worst case is that we have to do $2^n-1$ evaluations of $f(x)$ to find out $x_w$.

The desired best case is to explore all the possible $x_w$ at the same time. We naturally choose $\vec{S} = \frac 1 {\sqrt{2^n}} (1, 1, ...1)^T$, which is the sum of all the bases of the qubits, to feed the oracle function $f$.

We know, $\vec{S} = \vec{S} - \frac 1 {\sqrt{2^n}} \vec{w}) + \frac 1  {\sqrt{2^n}} \vec{w}$. Apparently, $\vec{S_1}  = \vec{S} - \frac 1 {\sqrt{2^n}} \vec{w}$ is a vector orthogonal to $\vec{w}$, and applying the $F$ gate to it does not change its phase. Therefore, $F(\vec{S}) = F(\vec{S_1}) + F(\frac 1  {\sqrt{2^n}} \vec{w})  = \vec{S_1} - \frac 1 {\sqrt{2^n}} \vec{w}$. We see that 
\begin{itemize}
    \item applying the $F$ gate turns vector $\vec{S}$ toward $-\vec{w}$
    \item applying the $F$ gate to $\vec{S_1}$ makes no change.
\end{itemize}
Therefore, can we apply $F$ gate $2^n$ times and turn $\vec{S}$ completely to $-\vec{w}$? But applying $F$ gate once more will change the phase of the $\vec{w}$ vector back. We need to change the sign of vector $\vec{w}$ first while preserving its angle with $\vec{S}$ before applying $F$ gate again. This can be accomplished by apply gate $U_S = 2 \vec{S}X\vec{S} -I$, which flip $\vec{w}$ around the vector $\vec{S}$. However, when implementing this flip, we need to rotate $vec{S}$ to the $\vec{0}$, do the flip, and rotate the frame back to $\vec{S}$.

\section{Simon's algorithm}
The Simon's algorithm assumes a blackbox oracle function $f(x)$ whose variable $x$ is a $n$-bit binary variable. Its results are $m$-bit values that are periodic, but the period $t$ is unknown -- $f(x+t)=(fx)$ for all $x$. How do we find the period $t$? Of course, we are tempted to play the trick again of feeding $\vec{S} = \frac 1 {\sqrt{2^n}} (1, 1, ...1)^T$ to the oracle function $f$. We have
$f(\vec{S}) = \frac 1  {\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_x f(x)$.

\section{HHL algorithm}
Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd (HHL) algorithm approximately solves linear equation $A x = b$ where $x$ and $b$ are $n$ dimensional vectors and $A$ is a $n x n$ hermitian matrix of complex numbers. The problem would be solved if we knew the orthonormal eigen-vectors ${v_i}, i=1, 2, ...n$ and the eigen-values ${\lambda_i}$ of $A$ because the eigen-values of $A^{-1}$ are  ${1/\lambda_i}$. By writing vector $b$ in terms of the eigen-vectors $b = {\sum^n}_{i=1} \beta_i v_i$, we can achieve our goal
\begin{equation}
    x = A^{-1} b = \sum^{n}_{i=1} \frac {\beta_i} {\lambda_i} v_i .
\end{equation}

Drawing from the technique used in the Deautsch's and Shor's algorithms, we need to "kick up" the eigen-values to the phases. Let's try
\begin{equation}\label{hhl-1}
    {\sum^n}_{i=1} \beta_i e^{i t \lambda_i} \keta{v_i}
\end{equation}
where $t$ is a constant to be determined soon. With the circuit of phase estimation, we then can bring the phases down to the second set of qubits
\begin{equation}\label{hhl-2}
    {\sum^n}_{i=1} \beta_i e^{i t \lambda_i} \keta{v_i} \keta{t\lambda_i}.
\end{equation}
We then apply controlled rotation gate to kick values of the second set of qubits to the $\theta$ of the third set of qubits, which contains only one, and have
\begin{equation}\label{hhl-3}
    \sum_{i=1}^n \beta_i e^{i t \lambda_i} \keta{v_i} \keta{t\lambda_i} \keta{cos\theta_i=\frac 1 {t\lambda_i}}.

\section{Types of waves}
Communication requires waves to propagate from one place to a remote place. Quantum computer qubits require stationary waves. By propagation characteristic, we can differentiate waves into propagating waves, standing waves and trapped waves.

Radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic waves are used for mobile communications including Wi-Fi. They can spread everywhere unless blocked or confined by reflective matters. Light waves -- electromagnetic waves with wavelength ranging from sub-micron to a few microns -- are used for optical communications. They can be channeled by optical waveguides such as optical fibers to explore different paths. They are confined in two dimensions -- the lateral dimensions -- but propagate in axial dimension along the the waveguides or fibers. Propagating waves are not ideal for building qubits for quantum computing. However, there have been clever designs that construct quantum computing circuits entirely using integrated optical waveguides.

If an electromagnetic wave is confined in three dimensions, such as in a microwave oven, the wave cannot propagate anywhere other than being reflected back and forth within the confinement. And only standing waves of specific frequencies can exist. The allowed frequencies are discrete. Standing waves are good for storing information. Superconductor qubits are constructed using standing waves of electrons, as described below. Standing waves may be best visualized and understood through the vibration of a guitar string. When a string is plucked, the propagation of the vibrations is stopped and reflected by the two fixed ends. Only the waves whose phases coincide after a complete round trip of reflection survive, while the other waves cancel each other out and are suppressed.

Another type of waves, which we may call trapped waves, is not confined by anything with boundaries but is instead trapped by forces extending to infinity. Electrons in an atom are trapped waves due to the electric force of the nucleus' positive charges. The waves extend to infinity but are concentrated within a nanometer around the nucleus. Trapped waves are also good for storing information. Trapped-ion and neutral-atom qubits are built by trapped electron waves.

\section{Devices using polarization modulation}
Polarization is the vibration direction of a wave. The polarization of an electromagnetic wave is perpendicular to its direction of propagation. An electron wave's spin may be considered its polarization and is measurable by applying a magnetic field. The angle of polarization $\theta$ can be used to represent information in addition to the wave's phase $\phi$. Many textbooks use electron spin qubits as examples. However, such type of qubits has not been adopted by practical experiments or products until recently\cite{nanotube} because of the difficulty of building spin manipulating devices.

Physicists have studied polarization of lights for hundreds of years. Engineers have developed all sorts of polarization-manipulating devices. Combination of polarization and phase modulation has been widely used in communication. The dominating modulation for free-space communication and optical fiber communication is dual polarization quadrature phase shift keying (DP-QPSK). Free space communication is mostly used for satellite-satellite communication. There is no substance in space to degrade the power of light waves. Free space communication can also be used for ship-ship and building-building communication on earth if the distance is not too far. Optical fiber communication is the fastest and cheapest choice for any wired communication of distance 100 meters or longer. The dominant modulation for long-distance optical fiber communication is also DP-QPSK.

Qubits for optical quantum communication naturally use the combination of polarization and phase modulation. Optical qubits have also been demonstrated in laboratories for quantum computing. Gates require manipulating wave polarization. They use optically transparent birefringent materials that have different speeds for lights of different polarization. Placing such a material in a light generator e.g. a laser, generation of light in one polarization direction is favored while the others are suppressed. A half-wave plate made from such a crystal can change the polarization angle of a light to any direction. Fig. \ref{Polarization-splitter} is a type of prism that can split the horizontal and vertical polarization components of a light that has off-angle polarization.

Fig. \ref{Demodulator-DP2} shows the functional diagram of a measurement gate. In communication term, it may be called a demodulator. The input wave from an output qubit is split into two perpendicular polarizing waves. Each wave is further split into two waves with a 90-degree phase difference. A single-photon detector is placed at the end of each wave. Because there is only one quantum of energy in the wave, only one electron in one of the detectors resonates with the wave and registers an electric current. From this detector, we can deduce the modulation point as shown in Fig. \ref{Demodulator-DP2}.

\section{Devices using optical waveguides}
Waveguides confine waves in two dimensions and allowing them to propagate in once dimension. Optical fibers are the mostly deployed. A couple of decades ago, radio-frequency cables for broadcasting TV signals were mostly deployed.
Another type of qubits uses lights confined in optical waveguides. Optical fiber is a type of waveguide. We use the optical wave in the waveguide on the left in Fig. \ref{Fiber} to encode the binary number 0 and label it $\keta{0}$. We use the one in waveguide on the right to encode 1 and label it $\keta{1}$. The two waves have the same frequency and amplitude. They don't overlap and are of course orthogonal to each other. If we bring the two waveguides together to overlap (using an optical coupler), we get a superposition wave that is a sum of both waves. If the sum has $cos\theta$ amount in amplitude from $\keta{0}$ wave contributes and $sin\theta_p$ amount in amplitude from the $\keta{1}$ wave, we can use the value $\theta_p$ to characterize the superposition wave.

The Xanadu.ai M-8 quantum computing chip assembles waveguide qubits and processing gates in an integrated waveguide circuit. We see it very much resembles a maze. The optical waveguides are the paths that light waves traverse. Its couplers and splitters resemble the junctions of maze. A coupler merge two light paths into one, and a splitter split one into two. The chip has 8 entrances and 8 exits and can build $8^8$ possible paths.

\section{Superconductor qubits}
A superconductor transmon qubit is similar to the string of a guitar and uses the first two standing waves, which resonate at the first and second harmonic frequencies respectively, to represent the integers of "0" and "1". Such a qubit is constructed by two superconductors separated by a layer of insulator. The insulator is thin enough for electrons to move ("tunnel") back and forth from one superconductor to another without loss of energy. But traveling through the insulator leads to delays (phase delays) of the electrons. The back-and-forth movement (vibration) of the electrons between the two superconductors resonate as standing waves at periods fractions of the delay. typically, the first fundamental frequency and the first harmonic are used to represent "0" and "1".
