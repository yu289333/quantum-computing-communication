abstract={Dual polarization quadrature phase-shifting keying (DP-QPSK) wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems are currently acting as the backbone of long-haul optical networks. It has provided a cost-effective solution for network up-gradation due to its backward compatibility on legacy infrastructure of standard single-mode fiber. Encoding of two bits per symbol per polarization, low BER over long haul transmission reach, and simple digital equalization techniques are the main features of 100G DP-QPSK technology. A large amount of voice, video, and high-speed data services are being provided by DP-QPSK WDM-based optical networks. This paper reviews the progress happened in the DP-QPSK WDM system since its introduction. The work is focused on reviewing important incorporations researched and developed related to the transmitter and digital coherent receiver.},

abstract={Electron spins in solid-state systems offer the promise of spin-based information processing devices. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), an all-carbon one-dimensional material whose spin-free environment and weak spin-orbit coupling promise long spin coherence times, offer a diverse degree of freedom for extended range of functionality not available to bulk systems. A key requirement limiting spin qubit implementation in SWCNTs is disciplined confinement of isolated spins. Here, we report the creation of highly confined electron spins in SWCNTs via a bottom-up approach. The record long coherence time of 8.2 {\textmu}s and spin-lattice relaxation time of 13{\thinspace}ms of these electronic spin qubits allow demonstration of quantum control operation manifested as Rabi oscillation. Investigation of the decoherence mechanism reveals an intrinsic coherence time of tens of milliseconds. These findings evident that combining molecular approaches with inorganic crystalline systems provides a powerful route for reproducible and scalable quantum materials suitable for qubit applications.},
