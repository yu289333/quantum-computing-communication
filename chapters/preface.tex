\chapter*{Preface}
Quantum computing and communication are hot topics. Software development kits (SDKs) including IBM Qiskit and Google Cirq have been made available to software engineers. However, quantum algorithms and protocols have been described as mysterious and incomprehensible -- requiring software and communication engineers to take a graduate course in quantum physics to understand them. In reality, quantum physics is about waves at the minuscule scale, in which they cannot be divided smaller. The principles of using waves have already been established by existing theories on communication and optical computing. The quantum algorithms and protocols are easy to understand when explained in the framework of these theories. Applying the principles of the theories, software and communication engineers may even be able to invent new quantum algorithms and protocols.
