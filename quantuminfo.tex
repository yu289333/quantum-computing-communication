\chapter*{Preface}
Quantum information and computing are hot topics. There are software development kits (SDKs), such as IBM Qiskit and Google Cirq, for programmers to develop quantum computer software. But there are no books on data structures and algorithms for computer science students. Similarly, there are no books on signaling and modulation for engineering students. This book is to bridge the gaps between quantum physics and engineering so that information and computer sciences students can use their knowledge to implement quantum algorithms and protocols or even develop them.

The difficulty of quantum physics lies in the wave behavior of particles. The focus of theoretical is how to solve the wave equations. And experimental physicists focus on how to control the waves. This book leaves out the details of the waves by labelling them with symbols e.g. "0" and "1". The symbols are what computer science and engineering students know how to work with. They are what the computer science data structure and algorithms, and Shannon information theory apply.

How to label waves with symbols is studied by encoding theory whose techniques have been studied by electrical engineering students. They are the bridge between physics in the analog world and information and computer sciences in the digital world.

\chapter{Introduction}
The advantage of quantum computing lies in the possibility of parallel computing using a quantum system. Quantum information theory is mostly used in distributing encryption keys for telecommunication using quantum systems -- the so called quantum key distribution. The secrecy of quantum key exchange lies in the uncertainty of quantum measurement. If these statements are too abstract, read on.

\section{The Advantage of Parallel Exploration}
Maze problems are hard. That's because there are too many paths to explore from the entrance to the exit. Computer scientists have long known parallel computing is the way to speed up finding solutions to such problems.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\includegraphics[width=6cm]{maze.png}
\caption{Maze}
\label{Maze}
\end{figure}

For a physicist, this experiment is the fast approach to a solution: run water into the entrance. If we see water out of the exit, we know the maze problem has at least one solution. But do we know whether there are more than one good paths or how many good paths there are? We can refine the experiment: run several water drops into the entrance. Of course, these are not the solution to the final maze problem, but we can keep on adding water tricks toward a solution.
Of course the solutions to such hard problems are to explore all the paths in parallel. Let’s look at how a physicist would use parallel exploration to solve the maze problems.

For the simplest case – we want to know if there is any good path at all. We can put water into the entrance. If there is any water coming out of the exit, we know the answer is positive. Adding complexity to the problem, we want to know how many good paths there are? Again, we can play the water trick. Let’s put several water drops into the entrance and see how many drops will come out. Until now, we don't have the solution to the final maze problem, but we can keep on adding water tricks toward a solution.

Playing with water tricks is exactly the idea behind quantum computers. Quantum physics tells us matters possess both wave behavior and particle behavior. The wave behavior is like the watery behavior and allows the wave to spread and propagate through out all possible paths. The particle behavior gives use the “drop” behavior and allows a particle to reveal the properties, e.g. the length, of the paths.

\section{The Particle and Wave Nature of Matters}
\subsection{Waves}
Waves are not strangers to us. We use electromagnetic waves every day. We get Wi-Fi or cellphone signals even when we move around, in a house or on the streets, because the waves can spread and explore unlimited paths to reach us. We can contain electromagnetic waves in boxes. Microwave ovens are examples. We can also use optical fibers, co-axile cables and waveguides to channel electromagnetic waves in one dimension along the cable lengths.

All matters, e.g. electrons, are waves in nature. When Ernest Rutherford discovered atomic nucleus, people raised the question: why does the size of an atom much bigger than that of its nucleus? Why wouldn't the tiny negatively charged electrons fall into positively charged nucleus and be combined into an atom close to the size of the nucleus. If the sizes of atoms were close to those of the nuclei, we would have not seen the world as we have. The question led to Bohr's proposal that electrons are waves and are much bigger in size than people thought they were.

\subsection{Wave measurements, characteristics and modulations}
When we get our blood pressured measured in a doctor's office, the height of the mercury in a glass column represents the measure. Our blood pressure is the information we seek. What we measure is the height of mercury in the column. In electrical engineering terminology, we call it modulation -- using the quantity of something that is easy to measure to represent the the number or information of our concern.

Just about all modern communications use electromagnetic waves, which are easy to transport, use the waves' amplitude, frequency and phase to represent information of concern -- the so called amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM) and phase modulation (PM). In human history, measurement of distances, sizes and time durations are develop first and have been mostly use to characterize things. However, we cannot use locations, sizes or time durations to characterize waves precisely and thus cannot use them for modulation. On the other hand, we can use wavelengths and periods to characterize waves precisely. The most simple waves are periodical in space and time. Their periods in space are their wavelengths. Their periods in time are, simply, their periods. The inverse of their periods are their frequencies. For some electromagnetic waves, such as light, wavelength is easier to measure. For others, frequency is easier to measure. Nevertheless, frequency modulation is equivalent to wavelength modulation or period modulation.

In wireless communications, combinations of the the waves' amplitudes and phases may be used. Getting fancier, quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) uses a combination of amplitude and phase so that more information can be represented in a wireless communication channel.

\subsection{Digital technology and modulation}
In theory, we can measure a wave's amplitude, frequency and phase precisely and use them to represent all real numbers. In really, our information transporting and processing devices generate noises and have errors. We are best to have the systems working with only integer numbers. Working with integer numbers is what we call digital technology. In addition, we can make our information transport and processing devices much simpler if the integer numbers are represented in them as binary numbers instead of decimals.


Because of noises and errors, we can't measure waves or anything of ultimate precision. 
With the advance of optical fiber technologies, we are able to concentrate light waves to micrometer scale in the cores of the glass fibers or waveguides, and information can be represented by determining which fibers or waveguides that the light waves travel.

What we encounter or what we use in the real life are not the simple waves. Waves concentrated in space and time are more useful. For example, in optical fiber communication, the light waves are not only concentrated in the micron-sized core of the fiber but also concentrated in time as sub-nanosecond pulses. The wave of an electron is concentrated around the nucleus of an atom, and we attribute the region of concentration as the size of the atom. These waves don't have wavelengths or frequencies, but each can be considered a mixture or superposition of waves of the simple waves with fixed wavelengths and frequencies.

\subsection{Measurement and the particle nature}
If we measure waves in any than other way space or time, we find their smallest "drops" -- the particle nature of matter. Quantum physics started a hundred years ago when Einstein first proposed that electromagnetic waves, when measured in their energy, have the smallest drops called photons.

When measuring in electric charge, physicists discovered the smallest drops first and call them electrons before they realized their wave nature.

Measurement is the very thing that the quantum world is different from the classical world. In the quantum world, with an article, you only have one chance to measure it. 

\subsection{Particles}
A particle is the smallest "drop" of matter. But "the smallest" by what measure? That is a critical question we should ask. By the amount of energy, a photon is the smallest drop of an electromagnetic wave. An electron is the smallest drop when measured by both mass and electric charge.

The waves and matters we see or use everyday contain too many particles, and we only see the average effects of the waves and matters. If we pluck guitar string and hear the note E, which is different in our ears from that played on a violin. That is because the sound from each string on the respective instrument is composed by many harmonics, an octave apart from each other. The average or combined effects from the strings of different instruments is different. If our ears were sensitive enough to hear individual phonons -- the smallest drops of sound -- we would hear sound of pure harmonics.
\begin{figure}[ht]
\includegraphics[width=6cm]{overtones.png}
\caption{The vibration of a string is a superposition of standing waves with wavelengths fractional of the string length.}
\label{Overtones}
\end{figure}
Of course making such single particle, photon or phonon, generators or detectors has been the very challenge to physicists in their effort to make quantum computing and communication.


\subsection{State and superposition}
From a wave's perspective, we see particles in it. From a particle's perspective, we can imagine it rides on a wave like a surfer following the trajectry defined by the wave. State is a quantum physics term referring to the wave that a particle rides on. Physicists use the wavefunction $\psi$ of the wave to note the state $|\psi>$ - the so called "ket" notation. But throughout this book, we use the labels e.g. "0" and "1" of the waves to note the states as $|0>$ and $|1>$. 

Can a particle be in two waves? Yes, it can. The two waves may be viewed as two by one measurement but are one by another measurement. In the case of a guitar string, the sound wave has all harmonics of frequency f, 2f, ... and is a superposition of these harmonic waves.
