# Quantum Information and Computing #

## About the project -- the book ##
Quantum information and computing are hot topics, and there are many books around. 
But there is no book for computer science or engineering students who have not 
taken any courses on quantum physics. Of course, there are many popular science 
books and articles that explain quantum physics by drawing analogy to laymen 
observable things. But can one use the analogies of quantum superposition or 
entanglement to (IBM) QIS programming? This book is to bridge the gap between 
quantum physics and engineering so that information and computer sciences 
students can use their knowledge to implement or even develop quantum algorithms and protocols.

## The project ##
The book project is initiated by Dr. Jiang and written in the open source approach. The whole world is welcome to contribute on
- the text
- the diagrams
- editing
- proof reading.
Depending on the evolution of the project, we may use other means to promote the book including publishing the book as an Amazon book.

## Tools ##
The book is written in LaTex (on overleaf.com). The project is coordinated over github.com

## About the chief author -- Yuan John Jiang, PhD ##
- BS in Physics, Peking (Beijing) University
- MS in Physics, City College of New York
- PhD inEelectrical Engineering, Columbia University
His PhD research is on quantum optics and semiconductor deveice physics for optical communication. He worked an engineer for 
telecommunication companies for 20 years and for a software company for 8 years. He has the unique insight in quantum physics
from the information and computer science perspect.
