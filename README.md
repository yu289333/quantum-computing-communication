# Quantum Information and Computing #

## About the project -- the book ##
Quantum information and computing are hot topics, and there are many books around. But there is no book for computer science or engineering students who have not taken any courses on quantum physics. Of course, there are many popular science books and articles that explain quantum physics by drawing analogy to laymen observable things. But can one use the analogies of quantum superposition or entanglement to (IBM) QIS programming? This book is to bridge the gap between quantum physics and engineering so that information and computer sciences students can use their knowledge to implement or even develop quantum algorithms and protocols.

The difficulty of quantum physics lies in the wave behavior of particles. The focus of theoretical is how to solve the wave equations. And experimental physicists focus on how to control the waves. This book leaves out the details of the waves by labelling them with symbols e.g. "0" and "1". The symbols are what computer science and engineering students know how to work with. They are what the computer science data structure and algorithms, and Shannon information theory apply.

## The project ##
The book project is initiated by Dr. Jiang and written in the open source approach. The whole world is welcome to contribute on
- the text
- the diagrams
- editing
- proof reading.
Depending on the evolution of the project, we may use other means to promote the book including publishing the book as an Amazon book.

## Tools ##
The book is written in LaTex (on overleaf.com). The project is coordinated over github.com
